Another course (CS357) taken at UIUC. The algorithms might be useful for future references.
Algorithms include
- Monte Carlo Simulation (see mp1)
- Sovling system of linear equation by LU decomposition and forward backward substitution (see mp2)
- Finding eigenvalue and eigenvector: power iteration, Rayleigh Quotatient iteration (see review_code.py)
- Markov chain and PageRank (see google_page_rank.py)
- Nonlinear problem: Newton in 1D, Secant, Bisection, and Newton in ND (see review_code.py)
- Optimization: Golden section search (1D), Newton in ND, and gradient descent (see review_code.py)
- Linear Least Square problem: sovling with SVD (see review_code.py)
- Principal component analysis (see review_code.py)
